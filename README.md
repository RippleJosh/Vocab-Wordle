# Vocab-Wordle

This is an any-length wordle-like script which takes a random word from a vocaulary list and then generates a Pygame display where students can input "guesses' until they correctly guess the word.
Similar to Wordle, after each attempt if a correct letter is input in the wrong location, the letter will be colored yellow while a correct letter in the correct location is colored green.

Currently users need to change the vocab list in the actual script, but a spreedsheet parsing feature is in the works.
A couple example lists are commented out in the script to dipict formating.

If you would like to test this code without running it locally, this project is also hosted at replit.
